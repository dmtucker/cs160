Unlike the other homeworks, this one only has one "problem," which is worth all 6 possible points.

Unzip it, and then run the "ShaderSchool.exe" program (you may need to work on a lab machine if you've got a Mac, unfortunately, but it's highly possible that you'll be able to complete the entire assignment during assigned lab times).

ShaderSchool has multiple lessons (#1-#4) and each lesson has a solution available via the "File" menu. The homework consists of solving lesson #4 and modifying the built-in solution to change either the motion or the lighting of the flag in that lesson. I highly recommend solving lessons #1-3 first, as they're designed to help teach you concepts useful in lesson #4.

Instead of submitting this assignment in-class, you'll turn your code in on eCommons (paste it into the comments field rather than attaching it). Make sure to include both your vertex and fragment shader code. As your assignment is to make something different from what the built-in solution does (either with different motion or different lighting) you won't get any points if you just turn in the code from the built-in solution.

That said, you're free to use the built-in solutions for all of the lessons, and to use the solution to #4 as starter code when designing your own solution.

Along with your code, please submit a video of the rendering result (as a youtube link in the assignment comments).

Like the other homeworks, this is due before the end of class (although it's due on Friday, December 6th), but it's an electronic submission via eCommons.
